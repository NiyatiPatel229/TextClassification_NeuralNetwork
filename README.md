## Introduction

Text classification is a common task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), involving the assignment of predefined categories to text data. This project implements a neural network to classify text data into categories, which can be adapted for a variety of text classification tasks like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization.
## Features

Customizable neural network architecture for text classification.
Preprocessing pipeline for text data including tokenization, vectorization, and padding.
Configurable hyperparameters for easy experimentation.

## Dataset

The dataset should consist of text samples with corresponding labels. Each sample should represent one instance of text data, and the labels should indicate the category or class for classification. You can replace this dataset with any other suitable dataset as per your use case.
## Model Architecture

This neural network model uses an embedding layer for text representation followed by dense layers to capture complex patterns in the data.
Model Summary
Embedding layer: Converts text tokens to dense vectors of fixed size.
Dense layers: Capture nonlinear patterns in text data.
Output layer: Softmax activation for multi-class classification.
## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using a categorical cross-entropy loss function optimized with the Adam optimizer. Accuracy and loss are monitored to ensure optimal performance. Validation data is used to track generalization.
## Results

After training, the model is evaluated on test data to provide metrics like accuracy and loss. Refer to the notebook for detailed training graphs and evaluation metrics.
